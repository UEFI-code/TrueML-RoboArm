# Neuro Cerebellum for RoboArm Self Calibration

## What is it?

We are working on let the robotic arm self-adaptive for Mechanical structure reshape.

## What is Special?

First, no human create Inverse Kinematics Equations from start to end.

Second, the Neuro Network can learn itself if you make change to the Mechanical structure.

## Stage A

Use BGD & teacher model to achieve reinformance learning.

Almost done at simulation, now working on the hardware.

## Stage B

Use few-shot learning (without BGD at runtime) to reach high performance
